Major Changes to the msp430 core software:

* Remove duplicate files between original x1 and Z1 (x2) 

* change usci port named back to h/w centric.  ie. Msp430Uart0 -> Msp430UartA0.  Better matches
  what will come in with the x5 code where there are lots of ports.

* Default clocks 1611 (x1) 4 MiHz, 2617/2618 (x2) 8 MiHz, 5137/5438 (x5) 16 MiHz

* use common clock module for x1 and x2.  msp430/clock_bcs.  Handles basic_clock and bc2.

* gdb files to support different processor families, tos/chips/msp430/99_gdb/gdb{x1,x2,x5}
  See tos/chips/msp430/99_gdb/gdbinit for details on how to use these files.

* add stack checking module.  This module allows one to monitor how much of the stack
  is being use.  See tos/chips/msp430/Stack*.

* Change DCO specifications from KHZ to HZ to eliminate confusion with decimal vs. binary
  frequency specs.  Make Z1 use binary clocks.

* Revised DCO calibrator to work with both 1611 and Z1 2617/1618.   Z1 uses dco calibrator
  to sync up to 8MiHz.
