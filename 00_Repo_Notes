* Toolchain:

The focus is on getting the new toolchain verified.  As such this repo is
intended to be tested using new toolchain (mspgcc 4.4.5, uniarch, ti headers).

Some testing with the old 3.2.3 toolchain (original tinyos and z1 varient) has
also been done for simple function (ie. does it compile).


* Repo Structure

The msp430.git repo is located at:

git clone ssh://hinrg.cs.jhu.edu/home/cire/msp430.git  (r/w)
git clone git://hinrg.cs.jhu.edu/git/cire/msp430.git   (read-only)

The msp430.git repo on hinrg belongs to group cire-git.  Users needing
repo write access need to belong to the cire-git group.

The msp430.git repo tracks the hinrg t2 git repo which in turn imports from the
main svn T2 trunk.

* Branches:

master: is the main branch coming from the svn t2 mainline.  Updated manually.

master-vhsb: (vogon hyper-spatial bypass)  Bypass the Z1 commits on the main
	trunk.  This branch tracks master but has the superfluous Z1 commit
	removed as it conflicts with the collapsed msp430 x2xxx work done in
	mm_core.  This collapsage forms the majority of the work of merging
	the trees and there isn't much sense in reinventing the wheel.

mm-z1: main consolidation branch for the mm-z1 integration.   It represents the
	current released version of the branch.  Later will be renamed to mm-z1.

z1-pu: working directory for Zolertia modifications.   From verification of mm-z1
       combined tree.

mm-pu: mammark (mm4) proposed updates.   Updated from the mm_core tree that should
       be integrated into the msp430 integration branch.

x5-pu: integrate x5xxx family into result of mm-z1.  Built on mm-z1 so will include
       all three major families (x1, x2, and x5).  Major cpu dependancies held in
       tos/chips/msp430/{x1xxx,x2xxx,x5xxx}


To pull a working branch do the following:

    cd ~/mm							# make sure at top level, we call it mm
    git clone git://hinrg.cs.jhu.edu/git/cire/msp430.git	# grab from ro place
    cd msp430
    git config --add push.default matching	# make sure only existing branches get pushed.
						# only effects rw repos
    git checkout -t origin/z1-pu		# tracking branch, will be on z1-pu when done
    git checkout -b work			# local working branch


To start with a read-write copy of the repo replace the clone with:

    git clone ssh://hinrg.cs.jhu.edu/home/cire/msp430.git	# grab from ro place

You need to have a login on hinrg and belong to group cire-git.

The other way to get your changes into the repo is to send a pointer to your git repo to
me (cire831@gmail.com) and I'll pull the changes and then push them up to hinrg.
