master: is the main branch coming from the svn t2 mainline.   It gets updated manually.

master_vhsb: (vogon hyper-spatial bypass) This branch tracks master but has the superfluous
	Z1 commit removed as it conflicts with the collapsed msp430 x2xxx work done in mm_core.

mm-z1: main consolidation branch for the mm-z1 integration.   It is the currently released
       version of the branch.

mm-z1-next: As changes get accepted they get brought back into -next.    When all is good
       next gets integrated into mm-z1.

mm-z1-pu: proposed updates.   After new code has been worked on for a bit and is ready to
       be integrated with other code in the mm-z1 area, mm-z1-pu is the place to put it.
       Some code from pu will go into next.  When enough stuff is ready to go in next, it
       is brought over to main (mm-z1).


To pull a working branch based on the mm-z1-pu branch (a reasonable place to fork a working
branch), do the following:

    cd ~/mm							# make sure at top level, we call it mm
    git clone git://hinrg.cs.jhu.edu/git/cire/msp430.git	# grab from ro place
    cd msp430
    git config --add push.default matching	# make sure only existing branches get pushed.
						# only effects rw repos
    git checkout -t origin/mm-z1-pu		# start with proposed updates
    git checkout -b work			# local working branch


To start with a read-write copy of the repo replace the clone with:

    git clone ssh://hinrg.cs.jhu.edu/home/cire/msp430.git	# grab from ro place

You need to have a login on hinrg and belong to group cire-git.
