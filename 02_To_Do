* fix copyrights

* apps/IPBaseStation: defines a reset in a particularily ugly way.   Needs to be
  fixed and made part of the platform/cpu definition.

* What is the purpose of msp430regtypes.h?  Is there a easier way to deal with this?

* There are multiple copies of msp430hardware.h.   Is that reasonable?

* i2c for msp430 isn't done yet.  needs to be cleaned up and made less ugly.  Interface
  needs to be finished.

  (done) Z1 currently overloads the SPI pins.   Switch to using I2C pins so it is clean.

* CC2420 modules use LocalIeeeEui64C to obtain an ipv6 link-local address.  Z1 needs to
  provide.  If the ds2401 (serializer chip) isn't supported how is this done?

* Currently config structs get put into ram via the data copy into ram mechanism.  This
  means that it takes up room in RAM and ROM.  Suboptimal.

* Original mm_core port removed McuPowerOverride.  Why?

* usart/msp430usart.h usci/msp430usci.h: define baud rates and configurations and h/w config
  values are defined.  Originally for the msp430f1611.  How should this stuff get dealt with
  for other chips and platforms.  Clocks and configuration values possible are quite variable
  with new chips.  This should probably be a platform dependency.

  This should be changed to get rid of the bit struct and replaced with something that uses
  the stuff from the TI HEADERS.

  Are the bit fields really used or can we nuke them.  Configuration uses a configuration struct
  and functional stuff is code that uses the definitions in the TI HEADERS and other cpu headers.

* Do we want to put in TOSThreads support?  Best way if yes is to #ifdef needed code in
  the interrupt handlers.  Old school mechanism clones the code.  Why did Kevin do that?

* Z1 uses I2C but never defines SDA or SCL.  Rather it overlays the I2C pins on the SPI pins.
  Works but isn't clean or straight forward.  Confusing for someone new picking up what is going
  on.

* Need better approach to assigning pins.  Should be a platform thing.  this makes it so drivers
  don't wire directly but instead wire to the platform ports.

* UcsiB add call Usci.setUmctl(0)?
