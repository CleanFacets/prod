* apps/IPBaseStation: defines a reset in a particularily ugly way.   Needs to be
  fixed and made part of the platform/cpu definition.

* What is the purpose of msp430regtypes.h?  Is there a easier way to deal with this?

* There are multiple copies of msp430hardware.h.   Is that reasonable?

* i2c for msp430 isn't done yet.  needs to be cleaned up and made less ugly.  Interface
  needs to be finished.

* CC2420 modules use LocalIeeeEui64C to obtain an ipv6 link-local address.  Z1 needs to
  provide.
